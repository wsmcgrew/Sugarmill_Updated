## The reason there are so many server folders!

* ```server``` -- API built using sequalize. Functionality so far includes (SELECT * FROM xxx) for every table

* ```Server_Sqlize``` -- Attempt at using sequalize to add authentication, a bust but want to keep.

* ```server - copy ``` contains original API using express, very crude but works with the front end
